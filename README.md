# Digital Rolodex

## Project Description
The Digital Rolodex is a Java console application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete different types of contacts. It supports three categories: Family, Business, and Friend. All contact information is stored in an SQLite database so the data remains available between program runs. The program uses object oriented design to keep the structure organized and easy to follow.

A video demonstration is included in this repository that shows the application running and gives a walkthrough of the project code.

## Project Tasks

**Task 1:  
Created the initial user interaction design and outlined how users would navigate the Digital Rolodex application.  
Developed the first set of classes to demonstrate inheritance and composition.

**Task 2:  
Created the software design documentation and expanded the class structure.  
Added polymorphism through multiple contact types and introduced an interface for shared behavior.

**Task 3:  
Implemented constructors for all contact types and applied access specifiers to organize and protect class data.  
Converted the main Contacts class into an abstract class to establish a shared base for all contact categories.

**Task 4:  
Integrated SQLite into the project using JDBC.  
Implemented database operations for inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting contact records.

**Task 5:  
Reviewed and refined the full Digital Rolodex application.  
Corrected errors, improved readability, enhanced formatting, and ensured all project specifications were met.

## Project Skills Learned
- Java object oriented programming  
- Working with abstract classes  
- Working with interfaces  
- Polymorphism  
- SQL and SQLite database operations  
- CRUD programming patterns  
- Project structure and code organization  
- Using GitHub for version control
